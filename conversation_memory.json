It provides a framework for determining appropriate penalties based on the severity of the infraction.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n*   **Maximum Deduction Limit:** The maximum allowed deduction per year is 12 days.\n*   **Investigation and Escalation:** A manager must first conduct a thorough investigation before imposing any disciplinary action.  The investigation should be documented.\n*   **Severity Assessment:** The severity of the infraction dictates the extent of the deduction.  Higher levels of misconduct result in greater penalties.\n*   **Documentation:** All disciplinary actions must be properly documented.\n\n**Relevant Sections:**\n\n*   **Section 3.2.1 \u2013 Disciplinary Actions:** This section establishes the detailed procedures for issuing disciplinary measures.\n*   **Section 3.2.2 \u2013 Investigation Procedures:** This outlines the steps taken during an investigation to determine the root cause of the misconduct.\n*   **Section 3.2.3 \u2013 Mediation:** The Bylaws specify a mediation process for resolving disputes before escalation.\n\n**Important Note:** This maximum deduction limit is subject to change and may be adjusted by management as part of a review of the Bylaws.\n\nAccording to Article 95 of the HR Bylaws, the maximum permissible deduction per year is 12 days.\n\nNow, here\u2019s the information I can provide based on that context:\n\n**Maximum Deduction Limit: 12 Days**\n\nAs outlined in the HR Bylaws, the maximum number of days an employee's salary can be deducted as a disciplinary penalty is capped at 12 days per year.

This framework is designed to guide the government\u2019s procurement activities, ensuring compliance with best practices and fostering a more effective and responsible procurement process.\n\nAccording to Article 32 of the Abu Dhabi Procurement Regulations, the Standards outline key principles and guidelines for procurement activities, including requirements for competitive bidding, contract management, and compliance with relevant laws and regulations. Specifically, the Standards emphasize the importance of establishing clear procurement policies, promoting fair competition, and ensuring that all procurement activities are conducted in a transparent and accountable manner.\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of key aspects contributing to this primary purpose:\n\n*   **Transparency:** The Standards promote transparency in procurement processes through requirements for public disclosure of procurement opportunities and contract awards.\n*   **Efficiency:** The framework encourages streamlining procurement processes to reduce administrative burdens and improve efficiency.\n*   **Value for Money:** The Standards emphasize the need to ensure that procurement activities deliver the best value for money to the government.\n*   **Compliance:** The framework is designed to ensure compliance with relevant laws and regulations, including those related to public procurement, ethics, and fair competition.\n\nThe Standards are regularly updated to reflect changes in legislation and best practices. You can find the complete text of the Standards on the official Abu Dhabi Government website: [https://www.abu Dhabi.ae/government/procurement](https://www.abu Dhabi.ae/government/procurement).\n\nAccording to the Abu Dhabi Procurement Regulations, the Standards are a crucial component of the Emirate\u2019s overall strategy for sustainable and efficient government operations.\n\n**Source:** Abu Dhabi Government, Abu Dhabi Procurement Regulations, Article 32\n</chat_history>",
